/**
 * Linear scales are the most common scale, and a good default choice to map a
 * continuous input domain to a continuous output range.
 * <p>
 * The mapping is linear in that the output range value y can be expressed as a
 * linear function of the input domain value x: y = mx + b.
 * <p>
 * The input domain is typically a dimension of the data that you want to
 * visualize, such as the height of students (measured in meters) in a sample
 * population.
 * <p>
 * The output range is typically a dimension of the desired output
 * visualization, such as the height of bars (measured in pixels) in a
 * histogram.
 * <p>
 * The default linear scale has a default domain of [0,1] and the default range
 * [0,1]. Thus, the default linear scale is equivalent to the identity function
 * for numbers; for example linear(0.5) returns 0.5.
 * <p>
 * Although linear scales typically have just two numeric values in their
 * domain, you can specify more than two values for a polylinear scale.
 * <p>
 * In this case, there must be an equivalent number of values in the output
 * range. A polylinear scale represents multiple piecewise linear scales that
 * divide a continuous domain and range. This is particularly useful for
 * defining diverging quantitative scales. For example, to interpolate between
 * white and red for negative values, and white and green for positive values,
 * say:
 * 
 * <pre>
 * {@code 
 * Scale color = d3.scale.linear().domain([-1, 0, 1]).range(["red","white", "green"]); 
 * }
 * </pre>
 * 
 * The resulting value of color(-.5) is rgb(255, 128, 128), and the value of
 * color(.5) is rgb(128, 192, 128).
 * <p>
 * Internally, polylinear scales perform a binary search for the output
 * interpolator corresponding to the given domain value. By repeating values in
 * both the domain and range, you can also force a chunk of the input domain to
 * map to a constant in the output range.
 * <p>
 * The output range must contain two or more values, to match the cardinality of
 * the input domain, otherwise the longer of the two is truncated to match the
 * other.
 * <p>
 * The elements in the output range array need not be numbers; any value that is
 * supported by the underlying interpolator will work.
 * <p>
 * However, numeric ranges are required for the {@link #invert(double)}
 * operator.
 * <p>
