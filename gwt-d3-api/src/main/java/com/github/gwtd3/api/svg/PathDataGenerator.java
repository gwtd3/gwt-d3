/**
 * 
 * A {@link PathDataGenerator} is an object containing information 
 * to simplify the construction of the <code>d</code> attribute for SVG <code>path</code> element,
 * allowing users to generate complex shapes.
 * <p>
 * The d attribute of SVG <code>path</code> defines the path data, which is a mini-language of path commands, 
 * such as moveto (M), lineto (L) and closepath (Z).
 * {@link PathDataGenerator}s are Javascript functions that generate these commands. <br>
 * From a Javascript point of view, a {@link PathDataGenerator} is both an object containing properties 
 * and a function that can be called to generate the path.
 * <p>
 * When passing the generator to the <code>d</code> attribute of a <code>path</code> selection, 
 * the function represented by the generator is called for each datum of the selection
 * data. The function takes the datum in argument and return the path.
 * <p>
 * Each generator specifies a default way of using the datum to create the path, but generally speaking, 
 * the default behaviour can be overriden by providing {@link DatumFunction}
 * for each generator attribute. Please refer to generator subclass documention for more information.
 * <p>
 * 
 * Usage:
 * <p>
 * 
 * <pre>
 * {@code 
 * PathDataGenerator pathGenerator = ... 
 * Selection g = D3.select("body").append("svg").append("g"); 
 * g.append("path").attr("d", pathGenerator); 
 * 
 * }
 * </pre>
