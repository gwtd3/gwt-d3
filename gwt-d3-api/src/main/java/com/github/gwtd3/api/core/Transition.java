/**

 * A transition is a special type of selection where the operators apply
 * smoothly over time rather than instantaneously. You derive a transition from
 * a selection using the transition operator. While transitions generally
 * support the same operators as selections (such as attr and style), not all
 * operators are supported; for example, you must append elements before a
 * transition starts. A remove operator is provided for convenient removal of
 * elements when the transition ends.
 * <p>
 * Transitions may have per-element delays and durations, computed using functions of data similar to other operators.
 * This makes it easy to stagger a transition for different elements, either based on data or index. For example, you
 * can sort elements and then stagger the transition for better perception of element reordering during the transition.
 * For more details on these techniques, see "Animated Transitions in Statistical Data Graphics" by Heer & Robertson.
 * <p>
 * D3 has many built-in interpolators to simplify the transitioning of arbitrary values. For instance, you can
 * transition from the font string "500 12px sans-serif" to "300 42px sans-serif", and D3 will find the numbers embedded
 * within the string, interpolating both font size and weight automatically. You can even interpolate arbitrary nested
 * objects and arrays or SVG path data. D3 allows custom interpolators should you find the built-in ones insufficient,
 * using the attrTween and styleTween operators. D3's interpolators provide the basis for scales and can be used outside
 * of transitions; an interpolator is a function that maps a parametric value t in the domain [0,1] to a color, number
 * or arbitrary value.
 * <p>
 * Only one transition may be active on a given element at a given time. However, multiple transitions may be scheduled
 * on the same element; provided they are staggered in time, each transition will run in sequence. If a newer transition
 * runs on a given element, it implicitly cancels any older transitions, including any that were scheduled but not yet
 * run. This allows new transitions, such as those in response to a new user event, to supersede older transitions even
 * if those older transitions are staged or have staggered delays. Multi-stage transitions (transitions that are created
 * during the "end" event of an earlier transition) are considered the same "age" as the original transition; internally
 * this is tracked by monotonically-increasing unique IDs which are inherited when multi-stage transitions are created.
 * <p>
 * For more on transitions, read the Working with Transitions tutorial.
