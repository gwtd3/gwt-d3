/**
 * Log scales are similar to linear scales, except there's a logarithmic
 * transform that is applied to the input domain value before the output range
 * value is computed.
 * <p>
 * The mapping to the output range value y can be expressed as a function of the
 * input domain value x: y = m log(*x*) + b.
 * <p>
 * Log scales also support negative values, in which case the input value is
 * multiplied by -1, and the resulting output value is also multiplied by -1.
 * <p>
 * However, note that the domain of a log scale should never contain zero, as
 * log(0) is negative infinity.
 * <p>
 * As with {@link LinearScale}s, log scales can also accept more than two values
 * for the domain and range, thus resulting in polylog scale.
