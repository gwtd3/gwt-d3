/**
 * D3's time scale is an extension of {@link LinearScale} that uses JavaScript
 * Date objects as the domain representation.
 * <p>
 * Thus, unlike the normal linear scale, domain values are coerced to dates
 * rather than numbers; similarly, the {@link #invert(double)} function returns
 * a date.
 * <p>
 * Most conveniently, the time scale also provides suitable ticks based on time
 * intervals, taking the pain out of generating axes for nearly any time-based
 * domain.
 * <p>
 * A scale object, such as that returned by d3.time.scale, is both an object and
 * a function. That is: you can call the scale like any other function, and the
 * scale has additional methods that change its behavior. Like other classes in
 * D3, scales follow the method chaining pattern where setter methods return the
 * scale itself, allowing multiple setters to be invoked in a concise statement.
 * <p>
 * The domain may be set as an array of two or more dates. If the elements in
 * the given array are not dates, they will be coerced to dates; this coercion
 * happens similarly when the scale is called.
 * <p>
 * Although time scales typically have just two dates in their domain, you can
 * specify more than two dates for a polylinear scale. In this case, there must
 * be an equivalent number of values in the output range.
 * <p>

	// =========== tickFormat ==========

	/**
	 * Returns a time {@link Formatter} function suitable for displaying a tick
	 * value.
	 * <p>
	 * The specified count should have the same value as the count that is used
	 * to generate the tick values. You don't have to use the scale's built-in
	 * tick format, but it automatically computes the appropriate display based
	 * on the input date.
	 * <p>
	 * The following time formats are considered:
	 * <ul>
	 * <li>%Y - for year boundaries, such as "2011".
	 * <li>%B - for month boundaries, such as "February".
	 * <li>%b %d - for week boundaries, such as "Feb 06".
	 * <li>%a %d - for day boundaries, such as "Mon 07".
	 * <li>%I %p - for hour boundaries, such as "01 AM".
	 * <li>%I:%M - for minute boundaries, such as "01:23".
	 * <li>:%S - for second boundaries, such as ":45".
	 * <li>.%L - milliseconds for all other times, such as ".012".
	 * </ul>
	 * By using multi-scale time formats, the default tick format provides both
	 * local and global context for each time interval.
	 * <p>
	 * For example, by showing the sequence [11 PM, Mon 07, 01 AM], the tick
	 * formatter reveals information about hours, dates, and day
	 * simultaneouslyâ€”rather than just the hours.
	 * <p>
	 * If you'd prefer single-scale time formatting, you can always use your own
	 * d3.time.format. You can also roll your own custom <a
	 * href="http://bl.ocks.org/4149176">multi-scale time format</a>.
	 * 
	 * 
	 * @param the
	 *            number of ticks to take into account to create the
