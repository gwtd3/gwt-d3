	/**
	 * Set the origin accessor to the specified function.
	 * <p>
	 * An origin accessor is used to determine the starting position (the
	 * â€œorigin?) of the element being dragged; this allows the drag behavior to
	 * preserve the offset between the mouse position and the starting element
	 * position during drag. If the origin accessor is null, then the element
	 * position is set to the mouse position on drag; this can cause a
	 * noticeable jump on large elements. If an origin accessor is specified,
	 * the function is called on mousedown. The function is invoked in the same
	 * manner as other operator functions, being passed the current datum d and
	 * index i, with the this context as the clicked-on DOM element. To access
	 * the current event, use the global {@link D3#event()}. The origin accessor
	 * must return an object with x and y properties representing the starting
	 * coordinates of the element being dragged.
	 * <p>
	 * Frequently the origin accessor is specified as Object, or
	 * {@link D3#identity()}, which is equivalent to the identity function. This
	 * is suitable when the datum bound to the dragged element is already an
	 * object with x and y attributes representing its current position.
	 * <p>
	 * For example: <a
	 * href="http://bl.ocks.org/1557377">http://bl.ocks.org/1557377</a>
	 * 
	 * @param o
	 *            the origin accessor function, returning an object with x and y
	 *            attributes.
	 * @return the object Drag.
