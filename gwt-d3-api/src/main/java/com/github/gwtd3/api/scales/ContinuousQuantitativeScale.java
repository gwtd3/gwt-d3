	 * for a valid value x in the input domain, scale.invert(apply(x)) equals x.
	 * <p>
	 * Equivalently, you can construct the invert operator by building a new
	 * scale while swapping the domain and range. The invert operator is
	 * particularly useful for interaction, say to determine the value in the
	 * input domain that corresponds to the pixel location under the mouse.
	 * <p>
	 * Note: the invert operator is only supported if the output range is
	 * numeric! D3 allows the output range to be any type; under the hood,
	 * d3.interpolate or a custom interpolator of your choice is used to map the
	 * normalized parameter t to a value in the output range. Thus, the output
	 * range may be colors, strings, or even arbitrary objects. As there is no
	 * facility to "uninterpolate" arbitrary types, the invert operator is
	 * currently supported only on numeric ranges.

	 * <p>
	 * For example, with the default domain and range of [0,1], an input value
	 * of 2 will return an output value of 2.

	 * the range [0,1], such that the return value of the scale is always within
